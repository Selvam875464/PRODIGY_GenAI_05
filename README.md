# PRODIGY_GenAI_05
**Task 5 – Neural Style Transfer**  
**Internship:** Generative AI – Prodigy InfoTech

## 📌 Description
This task implements neural style transfer using TensorFlow Hub. A pre-trained model applies the artistic style of one image (e.g., a painting) to the content of another image (e.g., photo of a dog).

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow & TensorFlow Hub
- Google Colab / VS Code
- PIL, Matplotlib

## 📁 Files
- `PRODIGY_GenAI_Task05_NeuralStyleTransfer.ipynb`: Full implementation and result

## ✅ Outcome
Successfully transferred the style of a sea wave image onto a black content image, resulting in a stylized image, completing Task 5 of the internship.
